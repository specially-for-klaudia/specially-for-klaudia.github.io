          Hi Klaudia, with this website specially for you, I would like to say a few things. I'm super grateful to have
          you in my life. You never fail to make me laugh and bring a smile to my face. Hanging out with you is just so
          much fun! You're super intelligent and passionate! You're super sweet and cute! I love it when you get a
          little shy and feel flustered. You're also so incredibly beautiful, gorgeous and sexy! I really like (I would
          even say the other four letters l word) mind and body! I hope we can meet again, because I want to give you a
          lot of cuddles and kisses! Take you out to nice dinners and go on adventures with you! I'm super proud of
          you and I mean that from the bottom of my heart!
        </p>
